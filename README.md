# DAW - First Year

This repository contains the projects developed during my first year in the **Web Application Development (DAW)** program. It includes the projects I have completed as part of the following subjects:

- **Programming**: Projects focused on learning programming logic, algorithms, and data structures. These projects involve C#.

- **Development Environments**: Projects related to setting up and working with development environments, including the installation and configuration of tools, editors, and platforms for efficient coding.

- **Markup Languages**: Projects focused on working with markup languages like HTML, XML, and others. These projects often include the creation and management of structured content on the web.
